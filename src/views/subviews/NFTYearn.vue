    <h1 class="mb-4">NFY</h1>
    <p class="mb-6 ta-l">NFY is a defi protocol that wraps ERC20 compliant defi assets in ERC721 compliant tokens, also called NFTs. This enables holders of ERC20 assets to manage those assets as a bundle. This is a similar premise to services provided by Curve and Cream. The distinction being that the assets bundled using NFY are treated as a block. This facilitates trading these assets with other defi protocols by enabling the management of multiple transactions referenced to a single holder.
<br><br>
For example, if a holder of a NFY NFT asset bundle that contains $DAI wishes to use their assets to transact with another defi protocol using $AMPL and receive the proceeds as $TRIB. The NFY protocol can facilitate the execution of the transactions needed to exchange the bundled assets for the asset needed for the desired transaction and to distribute the proceeds.
